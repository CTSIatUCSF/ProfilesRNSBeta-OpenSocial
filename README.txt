Professional Networking and Expertise Mining for Research Collaboration

Profiles Research Networking Software is an NIH-funded open source tool to speed the process of finding researchers with specific areas of expertise for collaboration and professional networking. Profiles RNS imports and analyzes "white pages" information, publications, and other data sources to create and maintain a complete searchable library of web-based electronic CVs. Built-in network analysis and data visualization tools allow administrators to generate research portfolios of their institution, discover connections between parts of their organization, and understand what factors influence collaboration.

This version of Profiles offers support for OpenSocial applications.
