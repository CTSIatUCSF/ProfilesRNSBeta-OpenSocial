<p>Whether you are UCSF faculty, a trainee, staff, affiliate organization member, community partner, industry partner, or other member of the UCSF ecosystem, we encourage you to <a href="mailto:ctsi@ucsf.edu">get in touch</a> with us about your ideas on how to improve this tool.  We especially look forward to hearing from you if UCSF Profiles has enabled your research in any way.  Your success stories allow us to continue to build on such tools and to continue to get support.</p>

<div class="sectionHeader"><a name="info" style="color:#CA7C29;font-size:13px">Information about UCSF Profiles</a></div>
<h3>When you view a person's profile, different types of information are displayed:</h3>

<ol> 
  <li>Information about the individual 
	<p>At a minimum, the Profile will contain the person’s name and basic contact information. This is the same information listed in the UCSF Directory. If the researcher has published articles available in PubMed, those publications will also be presented. Profile owners can also edit their own profiles, providing a research narrative, a photo, other publications, awards, links to other sites, etc. </p></li>
  <li>Networks that include the individual
	<p>UCSF Profiles builds and displays networks centered around the individual, including other researchers with whom they have co-authored a paper, researchers working on the same topics (as defined by the "MeSH" keywords assigned by PubMed to their publications), and working in the same department or building. The networks a person belongs to are shown on the right side of the page when viewing a profile. </p></li>
<!--
  <li>Active Networks
	<p>Active networks are the ones that you define. When UCSF users login to the website and view other people's profiles, they can mark those people as collaborators, advisors, or advisees. In other words, you can build your own network of people that you know. Currently, you can only see the networks that you build. In the future you will be able to share these lists with others. Active networks are shown on your left sidebar.</p></li>

<h3><a name="who" style="color:#333">Who is listed in UCSF Profiles?</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>The initial collection of profiles primarily includes UCSF faculty members, researchers with academic leadership appointments, and postdoctoral scholars. We are expanding Profiles to include other populations. </li>
  <li>Please note: there may be a lag between a person’s hire date and generation of their full profile with publications.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="view" style="color:#333">Who can view UCSF Profiles?</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>UCSF Profiles is searchable and can be viewed by the general public as well as the UCSF community.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="edit"><a name="edit" style="color:#333">How do I edit my Profile?</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>To edit your profile, click the Edit My Profile link in the menu bar or on the left sidebar. You will be prompted to login with your MyAccess account. </li>
  <li>Your profile is divided into several sections: directory information, photo, awards and honors, narrative, and publications.</li> 
  <li>UCSF Profiles uses Campus Locator System data for your directory entry. Changes to this information should be directed to the Payroll/Personnel Analyst for your UCSF campus department. If unsure who this person is, contact your department's Business Officer.</li>
  <li>You can display or hide each section, except directory information, by clicking the hide/show links. </li>
  <li>You can upload a photo and also add/edit the content in the awards, narrative, and publications sections. </li>
  <li>Keywords are derived automatically from the PubMed articles listed with your profile. You cannot edit keywords directly, but you can improve these lists by keeping your publications up to date. </li>
  <li><a href="mailto:ctsi@ucsf.edu">Contact us</a> if you have questions about editing your profile.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="login" style="color:#333">How do I login to UCSF Profiles?</a></h3>
<p>To facilitate UCSF's transition to a "one username and password" environment, we've integrated UCSF Profiles with the UCSF's Federated Login system called "MyAccess”. The MyAccess login/password is the same used for the Campus VPN.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you have a MyAccess account, you should automatically be directed back to UCSF Profiles after logging in. TIP: The MyAccess login/password is the same used for the Campus VPN.</li>
  <li>If you have never used your MyAccess account or for password support: go to <a href="https://myaccess.ucsf.edu/" title="Go to the UCSF ITS website" target="_new">https://myaccess.ucsf.edu/</a> or call ITS Customer Support at (415) 514-4100 (option 2).</li> 
  <li><a href="http://oaais.ucsf.edu/service_catalog/MyAccess.html" title="Go to the UCSF ITS website" target="_new">Learn more about MyAccess</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="data" style="color:#333">What are the sources of data for UCSF Profiles?</a></h3> 
<ul>
  <li>All data shown by default on this website are currently available on other public websites.</li> 
  <li>Contact information was obtained from the Campus Locator System, which also feeds the central UCSF Directory.</li>
  <li>Publications are derived from the MEDLINE/PubMed citation database. </li>
  <li>Narrative and other personalized data is entered by the profile owner or their designated proxy. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="network" style="color:#333">What are the lists on the right side of my profile?</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The lists at the right side of a profile page are keywords derived from publications’ MeSH terms and networks that are formed automatically when people share something in common, such as co-authoring a paper together.</li>
  <li>This summary is organized in a series of MeSH terms used by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to index the MEDLINE publications in each UCSF profile. </li>
  <li>Lists of keywords, co-authors and similar people at UCSF are derived from publications and are created automatically based on the MeSH terms.</li>
  <li>Department lists are determined from locator data (see data sources above) and reflect people in the same department.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="missing" style="color:#333">Why are there missing or incorrect publications in my profile?</a></h3> 
<ul>
  <li>Unfortunately, there is no easy way to exactly match all articles in PubMed to the appropriate author in UCSF Profiles with complete precision and accuracy. The algorithm used to find articles from PubMed attempts to minimize the number of publications incorrectly added to a profile; however, this method results in some missing publications. </li>
  <li>People with common names or whose articles were written at other institutions are most likely to have incomplete publication lists. </li>
  <li>Publications can be edited manually (see <a href="HowProfilesWorks.aspx#edit">How do I edit my Profile?</a> above). Adding publications manually helps UCSF Profiles know which topics of interest are associated with that profile and will increase the likelihood of finding the right publications on subsequent attempts. </li>
  <li>We encourage you to login to the site and add any missing publications or remove incorrect ones. To tell us how we’re doing or for questions regarding publications please send a note to <a href="mailto:ctsi@ucsf.edu">ctsi@ucsf.edu</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="update" style="color:#333">How frequently are the data in the profiles updated?</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Directory information in UCSF Profiles, such as names, degrees, and contact information is automatically updated from changes made to your primary campus information via your HR department. We update these changes once a week.</li>
  <li>Publications are updated from PubMed at least monthly.</li>
  <li>UCSF faculty can edit portions of their profiles, including publications, at any time by logging in via MyAccess.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="keyword" style="color:#333">Can I edit my keywords, co-authors, or list of similar people?</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keywords and co-authors at UCSF are derived automatically from the PubMed articles listed with your profile. You cannot edit these directly, but you can improve these lists by keeping your publications up to date. Please note that it takes up to 24 hours for the system to update your keywords, co-authors, and similar people after you have modified your publications. </li>
  <li>Keyword rankings and similar people lists are based on algorithms that weigh multiple factors including the number of corresponding publications, how relevant the concepts are to the overall topics of the publications, how long ago the publications were written, whether the person was the first or senior author and how many other people have written about the same topic.</li> 
  <li>A future version of UCSF Profiles will allow users to add custom keywords to their profiles. These will be separate from the automatically derived terms.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="mynetwork" style="color:#333">How can I create or edit “my network”?</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Active networks are shown on the left side of the page and are the ones that you define. </li>
  <li>When UCSF users login to the website and view other people's profiles, they can mark those people as collaborators, advisors, or advisees. In other words, you can build your own network of people that you know. </li>
  <li>Currently, only you can see the networks that you build. In the future you will be able to share these lists with others. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="learn" style="color:#333">How can I learn more about UCSF Profiles?</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="AboutUCSFProfiles.aspx">Read more</a> about the Profiles tool, ongoing development and exciting collaborations.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="ideas" style="color:#333">Where should I send my ideas on how to improve the tool?</a></h3> 
<ul>
  <li>We encourage you to <a href="mailto:ctsi@ucsf.edu">get in touch</a> with us about your ideas on how to improve UCSF Profiles.  We especially look forward to hearing from you if Profiles has enabled your research in any way.  Your success stories allow us to continue to build on such tools and to continue to get support.</li>
